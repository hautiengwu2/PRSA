# PRSA
Matlab code of phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) algorithm, and code for reproducing figures of the new paper

PRSA.m is the main PRSA algorithm code.
armaxfilter_simulate, acf, inverse_ar_roots, newlagmatrix are from the MFEToolbox
Run simu_XX to generate figures in the paper "Theoretical analysis of phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) algorithm"
